# Python Project Template (examplepyapp)

This repository contains a modern Python project managed entirely with [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/), a reproducible and declarative environment manager. All build and packaging metadata is consolidated in a single `pyproject.toml` file, following modern Python packaging standards.

## Getting Started

This project uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) as the single tool for managing environments, dependencies, packaging, and task execution.

### 1. Install Pixi

Follow the installation instructions from the [Pixi website](https://pixi.sh/), or use:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Run the following command to create and activate the project environment with all dependencies:

```bash
pixi install
```

### 3. Explore Available Tasks

Use the following command to list all project-defined tasks:

```bash
pixi run
```

Example tasks:
- `build-pypi`: build the PyPI wheel
- `build-conda`: build the Conda package
- `test`: run the test suite
- `publish-conda`, `publish-pypi`: publish the built artifacts
- `clean-*`: clean build artifacts

### 4. Development Workflow

Activate the Pixi environment:

```bash
pixi shell
```

Then, for development:

- Run tests: `pixi run test`
- Run linting: `ruff check .`
- Perform editable install: `pip install --no-deps -e .`

This ensures your environment remains clean and all tasks are reproducible.

- üßº **Linting & formatting** with [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
- üöÄ **Task automation** via `pixi run`
- üîÅ Supports CLI and optional GUI through modular structure in `src/packagenamepy/`

## Codebase Adjustments

1. Adjust the branch protection rules for the new repo. By default, we should protect the `main` (stable), `qa` (release candidate), and `next` (development) branches.

    1.1 Go to the `Settings` tab of the new repo.

    1.2 Click on `Branches` on the left side.

    1.3 Click on `Add rule` button.

    1.4 Follow the instructions from Github.

1. Change the License if MIT license is not suitable for you project. For more information about licenses, please
refer to [Choose an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/).

1. Adjust pre-commit configuration file, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to enable/disable the hooks you need. For more information about pre-commit, please refer to [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

1. Having code coverage, `codecov.yaml` is **strongly recommended**, please refer to [Code coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/) for more information.

1. Adjust the GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD to align with Pixi-only packaging. For more information about GitHub Actions, please refer to [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

    - Ensure that `.github/workflows/package.yaml` uses only `pixi run` commands for all build and publish steps.

    - Validate that the following Pixi tasks are correctly invoked:

        - `pixi run build-pypi`
        - `pixi run build-conda`
        - `pixi run publish-pypi`
        - `pixi run publish-conda`

    - Remove or disable any steps using `conda-build`, `python setup.py`, or `pip install .`.

1. The legacy `conda.recipe/meta.yaml` is no longer needed since Conda packaging is now handled via Pixi and `pyproject.toml`.

   - You may delete the `conda.recipe` folder entirely, unless it's still needed for backward compatibility with older workflows.

1. Adjust `pyproject.toml` to match your project. For more information about `pyproject.toml`,
please refer to [pyproject.toml](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/).

    - Specify package name at: pyproject.toml#L5

    - Specify package description at: pyproject.toml#L6

    - Specify any terminal entry points (terminal commands) at: pyproject.toml#30.

1. Adjust files for pixi

    - After updating your environment file, make sure to run `pixi install` and commit the updated lock file.

    - Specify package name at: pyproject.toml#L65

        > In the example, invoking `packagename-cli` in a terminal is equivalent to running the python script `from packagenamepy.packagename import main; main()`

    - Projects will use a  single `pyproject.toml` file to manage all the project metadata, including the project name, version, author, license, etc.

    - Python has moved away from `setup.cfg`/`setup.py`, and we would like to follow the trend for our new projects.

1. Specify package name at  src/packagenamepy

1. Specify package name at: src/packagenamepy/packagename.py

1. If a GUI isn't used, delete the MVP structure at src/packagenamepy:

    - mainwindow.py
    - home/
    - help/

1. Clear the content of this file and add your own README.md as the project README file.
We recommend putting badges of the project status at the top of the README file.
For more information about badges, please refer to [shields.io](https://shields.io/).

## Repository Adjustments

### Add an access token to anaconda

Here we assume your intent is to upload the conda package to the [anaconda.org/neutrons](https://anaconda.org/neutrons) organization.
An administrator of `anaconda.org/neutrons` must create an access token for your repository in the [access settings](https://anaconda.org/neutrons/settings/access).

After created, the token must be stored in a `repository secret`:

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub.com.
1. Click on the "Settings" tab.
1. In the left sidebar, navigate to the "Security" section and select "Secrets and variables" followed by "Actions".
1. Click on the "New repository secret" button.
1. Enter `ANACONDA_TOKEN` for the secret name
1. Paste the Anaconda access token
1. Click on the "Add secret" button
1. Test the setup by creating a release candidate tag,
which will result in a package built and uploaded to `https://anaconda.org/neutrons/mypackagename`

### Add an access token to codecov

Follow the instructions in the [Confluence page](https://ornl-neutrons.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDPD/pages/103546883/Coverage+reports)
to create the access token.

## Build & Publish Packages

Both PyPI and Conda packages are supported. All build and publishing steps are defined in Pixi tasks.

### Publish to PyPI

1. Ensure you have access to the project on PyPI.
2. Clean working directory: `git status` should be clean.
3. Run the Pixi task to build the wheel:

   ```bash
   pixi run build-pypi
   ```

4. Check the wheel for issues manually:

   ```bash
   twine check dist/*
   ```

5. Upload to TestPyPI:

   ```bash
   pixi run publish-pypi-test
   ```

   Ensure your `~/.pypirc` contains the correct token:

   ```ini
   [distutils]
   index-servers = pypi testpypi

   [testpypi]
   repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
   username = __token__
   password = YOUR_TESTPYPI_TOKEN
   ```

6. Install from TestPyPI to verify:

   ```bash
   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ examplepyapp
   ```

7. When ready, trigger the GitHub Action (`package.yaml`) to upload to PyPI.

### Publish to Anaconda (Conda)

1. Ensure the target channel is correct in `.github/workflows/package.yaml`.
2. Run the Pixi build:

   ```bash
   pixi run build-conda
   ```

   This creates a `.conda` package in the project root.

3. Publish using:

   ```bash
   pixi run publish-conda
   ```

   Ensure the `ANACONDA_TOKEN` secret is configured in GitHub for CI/CD to work.

## Development environment setup

### Build development environment

1. By default, we recommend using `pixi install` to set up the development environment.
   This will create a virtual environment in the `.pixi` directory at the root of the repository.
1. If you prefer to use a detached environment, set the `detached-environments` option to `true` in `.pixi/config.toml`:

   ```bash
   pixi config set detached-environments true
   ```

1. If you want to keep your environment between sessions, add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

   ```bash
   export PIXI_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.pixi/cache"
   ```

1. After setting up the environment, you can activate it with:

   ```bash
   pixi shell
   ```

1. If you are using VSCode as your IDE, we recommend to start code with `pixi run code .` to ensure the correct environment is inherited by the IDE. Alternatively, you can also manually edit the `.vscode/settings.json` file to set the Python interpreter path:

   ```json
   {
       "python.pythonPath": ".pixi/venv/bin/python"
   }
   ```

## Pixi

Pixi is the single tool used to manage environments, dependencies, packaging, and task execution for this project. All metadata is centralized in `pyproject.toml`, eliminating the need for `environment.yml` or `meta.yaml`.

### How to use Pixi

1. Install `pixi` by running `curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash` (or following the instruction on the [official website](https://pixi.sh/))
1. To avoid build failures from environments in the source tree, enable detached environments:

    ```bash
    pixi config set detached-environments true
    ```

    Commit `.pixi/config.toml` to your repository to ensure consistent behavior across environments.
1. Run `pixi install` to install the dependencies.
1. Adjust the tasks in `pyproject.toml` to match your project's needs.
   3.1. Detailed instructions on adding tasks can be found in the [official documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/features/tasks/).
   3.2. You can use `pixi run` to see available tasks, and use `pixi run <task-name>` to run a specific task (note: if the selected task has dependencies, they will be run first).

    ```bash
    ‚ùØ pixi run

    Available tasks:
            build-conda
            build-docs
            build-pypi
            clean-all
            clean-conda
            clean-docs
            clean-pypi
            publish-conda
            publish-pypi
            test
            verify-conda
    ```

### Pixi environment location

By default, `pixi` will create a virtual environment in the `.pixi` directory at the root of the repository.
However, when setting `detached-environments` to `true`, `pixi` will create the virtual environment in the cache directory (see [official documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/features/environment/#caching-packages) for more information).
If you want to keep your environment between sessions, you should add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
export PIXI_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.pixi/cache"
```

### Known issues

On SNS Analysis systems, the `pixi run build-conda` task will fail due to `sqlite3` file locking issue.
This is most likely due to the user directory being a shared mount, which interfering with `pixi` and `conda` environment locking.
